Java Code Repository


Description:
This repository contains a collection of Java code examples for basic programming concepts. The codes are designed to demonstrate fundamental programming principles, including loops, conditions, arrays, and functions.

Programs Included:
printDigits: A program that prints the digits of a given number
countDigits: A program that counts the digits in a given number
armstrong number: A program that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not
reverse: A program that reverses a given number
printNumber: A program that prints the numbers from 1 to n
rotate array: A program that rotates an array by a given number of positions
These programs aim to showcase my programming skills and understanding of basic programming concepts to potential employers and collaborators. Each program includes a detailed README file that explains its purpose, functionality, and usage instructions.
